Considering the growing demand of photography films at the moment He was motivated to venture into the field to quench the thirst.It was completely out of thought for such a young soul to make such efforts into photography field-the field that which was molstly dominated by the white race, besides the financial constraints.
        The story behind this empire is so amazing and motivating, it portrays a good example of following and working hard towards a destiny. DKorir Photography Studio has been through alot of struggles and the most that hit the media was when the former C.E.O DKorir was arrested and arraigned in court for having allegedly deviced a way to evade taxes payment, it was later confirmed that it was all conspiracy by conlflicting parties.
