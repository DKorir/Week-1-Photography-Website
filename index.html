    <h1>DKLight Photography Studio</h1>
    <p class="description">DKorir Photography Studio(DPS) was created by Dominic Korir(DK) in the year 1997. Considering the growing demand of photography material for keeping memories and lovely moments.He was motivated to venture into the field to quench the thirst and his ambitions.It was completely out of thought for such a young soul to make such efforts into photography field-the field that which was completely strange besides the financial constraints for printing of the photos, purchasing of the hard-disks and computers.
    The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image – a photograph – on lightsensitive film or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.
